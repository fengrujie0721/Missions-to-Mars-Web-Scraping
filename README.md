# Web-Scraping-Challenge

Build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML.

Scrape the [Mars News Site](https://redplanetscience.com/) and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that you can reference later.
